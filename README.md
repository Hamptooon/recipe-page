## ⚙️ My Process

### 🛠 Built With

- ✅ **Semantic HTML5** for structured, meaningful markup.
- 🎨 **CSS Flexbox** to create flexible layouts.
- 📱 **Responsive Design** using media queries and modern units like `clamp()` for smooth scaling across devices.
- 🧩 **SCSS 7-1 Architecture** for a modular and organized structure.
- 🛠 **SCSS Mixins** to simplify reusable styles and maintain clean, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code.

### 📚 What I Learned

This project helped me:

- Improve **semantic HTML** to ensure proper document structure.
- Master **responsive design** using **`clamp()`**, allowing for fluid font sizes and padding adjustments that look great on large screens, including 4K monitors.
- Organize CSS efficiently using **7-1 SCSS architecture**, making the stylesheets scalable and easy to maintain.
- Use **SCSS Mixins** for creating reusable, consistent design components across the page.
